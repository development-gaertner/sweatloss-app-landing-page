# Privacy Policy

At Sweatloss, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our hydration tracking app.

<br>

## 1. Data We Collect

**We do not collect any personal data.** Sweatloss is designed with privacy at its core. We do not collect, store, or have access to your name, email address, location, or any other personally identifiable information.

<br>

## 2. Local Data Storage

All of your hydration tracking data (water intake logs, goals, preferences, and statistics) is stored **locally on your device only**. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to use optional features described below.

You maintain complete ownership and control of your data at all times.

<br>

## 3. Third-Party Services

Sweatloss uses the following optional third-party services:

### Crashlytics (Firebase Crashlytics)
We use Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash reports and performance data. This helps us identify and fix bugs to improve app stability. No personal information is collected through Crashlytics.

### iCloud Sync (Optional)
You can optionally enable iCloud sync to back up your hydration data across your Apple devices. When enabled:
- Your data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account
- We do not have access to your iCloud data
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time in the app settings
- iCloud data is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy

### Apple HealthKit (Optional)
You can optionally connect Sweatloss with Apple Health to:
- Import hydration data from other apps
- Export your water intake to Apple Health

When you enable HealthKit integration:
- Data sharing is controlled entirely by you through iOS permissions
- Your health data stays within Apple Health and is not transmitted to us
- You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in iOS Settings
- HealthKit data is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy

<br>

## 4. Data Sharing

**We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.** Since we don't collect personal data, there is nothing to share. The optional services mentioned above (Crashlytics, iCloud, HealthKit) are controlled by you and governed by their respective privacy policies.

<br>

## 5. Your Control

You have complete control over your data:
- **Delete Data**: You can delete all your hydration data at any time within the app
- **Disable Sync**: Turn off iCloud sync in app settings to keep data local only
- **Revoke Permissions**: Remove HealthKit access through iOS Settings
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalling the app will delete all local data from your device

<br>

## 6. Children's Privacy

Sweatloss does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app can be safely used by anyone without privacy concerns.

<br>

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

Significant changes will be communicated through:
- App Store release notes
- In-app notifications
